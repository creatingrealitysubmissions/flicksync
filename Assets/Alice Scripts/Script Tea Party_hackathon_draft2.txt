                ALICE
    Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse. Only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.

                MARCH HARE
    No room!

                HATTER
    No room!

                DOREMOUSE
    No room!

                ALICE
    There's plenty of room!

                MARCH HARE
    Have some wine.

                ALICE
    I don't see any wine.

                MARCH HARE
    There isn't any.

                ALICE
    Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.

                MARCH HARE
    It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited.

                ALICE
    I didn't know it was your table. It's laid for a great many more than three.

                HATTER
    Your hair wants cutting.

                ALICE
    You should learn not to make personal remarks. It's very rude.

                HATTER
    Why is a raven like a writing-desk?

                ALICE
    Come, we shall have some fun now! I'm glad they've begun asking riddles. - I believe I can guess that.

                MARCH HARE
    Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?

                ALICE
    Exactly so.

                MARCH HARE
    Then you should say what you mean.

                ALICE
    I do. At least - at least I mean what I say - that's the same thing, you know.

                HATTER
    Not the same thing a bit! You might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!

                DOREMOUSE
    You might just as well say, that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!

                HATTER
    It is the same thing with you.

                HATTER
    What day of the month is it?

                ALICE
    The fourth.

                HATTER
    Two days wrong! I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!

                MARCH HARE
    It was the best butter.

                HATTER
    Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.

                MARCH HARE
    It was the best butter, you know.

                ALICE
    What a funny watch! It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!

                HATTER
    Why should it? Does your watch tell you what year it is?

                ALICE
    Of course not. But that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.

                HATTER
    Which is just the case with mine.

                ALICE
    I don't quite understand you.

                DOREMOUSE
    Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.

                HATTER
    Have you guessed the riddle yet?

                ALICE
    No, I give it up. What's the answer?

                HATTER
    I haven't the slightest idea.

                MARCH HARE
    Nor I

                ALICE
    I think you might do something better with the time than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.
